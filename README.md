# Authorization
The frontend is meant to be runned on Azure App Service protected by easy auth which provides /.auth/me and /.auth/refresh endpoints for
obtaining and refreshing the access tokens. These tokens are obtained 
and attached to the header of every axios request using the auth module.

For ease of use, if /.auth/* endpoints are not present, it is assumed the app is running in the localhost mode and no token/header bussiness is performed.
